      "- **Travel Time:** Approximately 6 minutes.\n",
      "- **Cost:** Between 110 kr and 140 kr.\n",
      "- **Scenic Value:** Low. While a taxi is the fastest way to reach Nybroplan from Ropsten, it doesn't offer the best scenic views since you'll be moving quickly through the city streets.\n",
      "- **Step-by-Step Guide:**\n",
      "  1. Book a taxi in advance or hail one from the street.\n",
      "  2. Provide the driver with your destination, Nybroplan.\n",
